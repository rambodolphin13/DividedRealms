# Pendragon Sovereign remake: Sword, Shield and Polearm

Status: design for owner review, 2026-11-06 (first draft). Nothing built. Branch `feature/pendragon-remake` (from
bot-ai-trips a362e10bb). Still overpowered on purpose. The Storm (64) and Tuatha (67) kits are not touched.

Owner picks (2026-11-06): weapons **Sword (Slash), Shield and Polearm** ("the ones the game currently has in it"),
core mechanic **Valor**.

## What is wrong today

The Pendragon (class 65) is still the old shared kit: a copy of the pre-remake Storm Sovereign renamed to holy fire.
Six weapon lines (Crush, Slash, Thrust, Polearm, Two Handed, Shields) with 7 generic styles each, 23 spell buttons that
mirror the old Storm table, the Royal Lion pet and the Lion of Albion form. It has no mechanic of its own.

## Identity

The Storm Sovereign is a burst-and-thunder king (Tempest charges on itself). The Tuatha Sovereign is a Sidhe king who
marks and detonates its enemies. The Pendragon is **the king who stands in front**: Arthur's knight-king. It holds the
line with block and parry, guards its allies, and turns every blow it takes into **Valor**, which it spends on
**Judgments**: holy-fire finishers that also heal and shield its party.

| | Storm Sovereign | Tuatha Sovereign | Pendragon Sovereign |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource | Tempest charges on yourself | Sidhe Marks on enemies | **Valor** on yourself, earned by **defending** |
| Spending | Finishers spend charges | Detonations burst marks | **Judgments**: holy fire + a party heal or ward |
| Defense | Block, parry | Evade, parry, block, thorns | **Block, parry, Guard** (take hits for an ally) |
| Control | Stuns | Roots, mesmerize, stuns | **Taunts**, stuns, knockback, snares |
| Group role | Damage | Damage, party heals in Seelie | **Protector**: guards, party wards, rallies |
| Damage | Energy, cold | Spirit, bleeds, rot | **Heat** (holy fire), burns |

## Weapons

**Slash (sword), Shields, Polearm, Parry, Stealth**, all training with level. Crush, Thrust and Two Handed stop
training and their styles go. Characters keep every item they own; loot and bots stop rolling those weapons for this
class (as was done for the Tuatha).

| Setup | Weapons | Plays as |
|---|---|---|
| Knight of the Shield | Sword (Excalibur) + shield (Pridwen) | The guardian: blocks and parries build Valor fast, guards allies, party wards |
| Lancer | Polearm (Rhongomyniad, Arthur's lance) | The charger: reach, sweeps and charges, the biggest Judgments |

## Valor

- Valor is **on yourself**, **0 to 5**. It decays one point every 8 seconds out of combat.
- You **earn** it by defending: every **block or parry** +1, a **melee hit taken** +1 (at most once every 3 seconds),
  an attack absorbed for a **guarded ally** +1, and the shield and reactive styles +1 or +2.
- You **spend** it with **Judgments** (finishing styles and the Judgment spells). Each Valor spent adds **+20% damage**
  and either **heals your party 3%** (sword and shield Judgments) or **wards your party** for 3% of its health
  (polearm Judgments), and at 5 Valor the Judgment also **stuns for 2 seconds**.
- **Showing Valor (open choice, see the end):** recommended, a gold "Valor" buff icon on your bar whose name shows the
  count (Valor 3), and a holy-light flash on you at 3 and again at 5 (stock paladin/cleric effects). No orbs: the
  Warlock chamber orbs stay the Storm's.

## Styles (61)

Unlock levels follow the Sovereign spacing (1, 3, 5, 8, 10 ... 48). Openers 0.85 growth, steps 1.1, Judgments 1.45-1.6.
**V+n** = earns Valor, **J** = Judgment (spends all Valor).

Three Pendragon ones replace the caster picks, like the other two Sovereigns:

- **Knight's Guard** (3 ranks): Guard of the Crown takes 60/70/80% of the blow and returns 10/20/30% of it as holy fire.
- **Grail Blessing** (3 ranks): Judgment heals and wards +25/50/75%.

## Regalia of Camelot (armor set)

Seven level 51 pieces, AF 102 / 27% (as the Storm and Tara sets), class 65 only, no trade or sale, ToA lines, a 2/4/6/7
set bonus (RegaliaSet), two use abilities and two armor procs, granted by the Pendragon trainer on a whispered keyword.
Placeholder: stock Albion plate art until the art pass; then crimson and gold royal plate with the red dragon of the
Pendragon and a lion-crowned cloak, made the same way as Tara (concepts first, owner picks).

## How it gets built

1. This draft, owner OK.
2. C#: Valor (PendragonValor, like StormTempest), the styles (PendragonRemakeStyles), spells (PendragonRemakeSpells),
   Guard of the Crown, the realm abilities and RegaliaSet use. Own ID ranges, checked free: styles 7300-7360, style
   effects 63900-63960, spells 65800-65927.
3. World Workshop edits file (pendragon_remake_edits.py), like the Tuatha's: specs, styles, spells, RAs, Regalia.
4. Unit tests, a private-copy boot and an AI tester run before handing over; install only with the owner's OK.

Players today: the owner's Yberrawin (level 1) and two AI tester characters at 50.

## Choices for the owner

1. **Showing Valor:** a gold buff icon with the count plus a holy flash at 3 and 5 (recommended), or flashes only.
2. **The transformation** (today model 1193, the Stygian Lion): keep it, or switch the way the Tuatha's became the
   Morrigan. 1.130 candidates: 614 Albion Stone Dragon (revamped; "Pendragon" means chief dragon), 696 Winged Gryphon,
   2122 Albion King, 1256 Starry Stygian Lion.
3. **The pet:** keep the Royal Lion (today model 100, a plain Tan Lion), or give it a better model (Black Lion 104,
   Sabertooth 694, Wingless Gryphon 698).
