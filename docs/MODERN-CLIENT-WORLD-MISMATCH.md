# Modern 1.130 client: world mismatch (October 26, 2026)

Tester reports (Orshe): pixie name tags in Tir na Nog, NPCs out of place in Druim Ligen and Mag Mell,
the Druim Ligen door "too far away".

Everything below was measured read-only. No server or client was started, nothing was deployed, and no
game database or client folder was changed. Scratch tools and outputs are in the session scratchpad.

## Summary

| Report | Cause |
|---|---|
| `[ambient pixie]-DOR-NON` | Not a bug. GM accounts see "-DOR" (untargetable) and "-NON" (hidden name) on NPC names (`PacketLib1124.cs:190-204`). |
| NPCs out of place, Druim Ligen door | The 1.130 client draws live's world. The server, database, navmeshes and bots use OpenDAoC's classic world. |

The classic client is a **1.127** build (`PacketLib1127` in the server log). It ships OpenDAoC's curated
classic world data. The retail 1.130 client ships live's world data. Both `game.dll`s use the same loader,
including `newtowns/zones/nifs`. OpenDAoC turns live's "New Towns" off by shipping that folder with only
its own 7 models.

### What differs (world data only)

1,313 files, 316 MB, in the classic client differ from or are missing in 1.130:

| Area | Classic-only / different | Effect on 1.130 |
|---|---|---|
| `Newtowns/zones/Nifs` | 1.130 has 196 extra live models; 5 of OpenDAoC's (border keeps, Avalon teleporter, demon portal) differ | Live building models (Gamebryo 10.1, all rebuilt art) are drawn in classic positions |
| 61 `zones/zoneNNN` folders | object tables, terrain, capital building pieces (`cam*`, `jord*`, `tir*`) | Building IDs and door IDs change; some terrain moves (Dartmoor up to 4,300 units) |
| `zones/Nifs` | 64 + 14 (relic keeps, mile forts, dragon lairs, gate forts) | Old-frontier keep doors differ |
| `zones/Dnifs` | 191 + 179 (dungeon pieces) | Dungeon geometry differs |
| `frontiers/Nifs`, `frontiers/zones` | 1 + 48, 70 | New Frontiers walls, gates, towers and door IDs differ |
| Marfach Caverns (region 276) | missing from 1.130 | 47 NPCs and 6 entrances unreachable on 1.130 |

### Measured impact on 1.130 today

Each client's world was exported with the repository's navmesh builder (`OpenDAoC-BuildNav --obj`),
and every NPC spawn was tested against both geometries:

- **469 NPC spawns** end up inside geometry, on a floor that moved more than 48 units, or with no floor.
  They cluster in about 20 places: Cotswold, Mularn, Mag Mell, the six border keeps (Castle Sauvage,
  Snowdonia Fortress, Svasud Faste, Vindsaul Faste, Druim Ligen, Druim Cain), Ardee, Huginfell, Dartmoor,
  Malmohus, Sheeroe, the old frontier keeps, and Jordheim. The other ~32,000 spawns in these zones are fine.
- **Doors** (333 classic doors checked): 77 missing, 53 moved, 75 extra. That includes 41 of 66 doors
  in the capitals, and 12/39/22 in New Frontiers.
- **Druim Ligen gate:** in live's `hborderkeep1` model the two gate doors `207156901` and `207156902`
  have swapped places, each about 2,200 units from where the server has it. The server rejects border
  keep doors beyond 3x the pickup distance, hence "too far away". Druim Ligen's guards stand on classic
  wall walkways (Z 5695) that don't exist in live's keep (floor Z 5184).

## Fix A: make the 1.130 client show the classic world

Overlay OpenDAoC's world data onto the player's 1.130 copy and remove live's 196 New Towns models.

**Simulated:** a scratch copy of the 1.130 client with the full overlay, exported the same way.
- Doors: **333 of 333 identical** to the classic client (outdoor zones, capitals, Stonehenge Barrows,
  Darkness Falls, all 14 New Frontiers zones). None missing, extra or moved.
- NPCs: **0 affected** out of about 25,000 in 30 zones, and 0 in New Frontiers.
- Swapping only the Newtowns folder is not enough. The 1.130 zone files renumber buildings, so door IDs
  stay wrong.

**Work:**
1. A generator that diffs the classic world data against a pristine 1.130 client and writes the overlay
   manifest: each path with its input SHA256 (or "absent"), output SHA256, and a removal list for the
   196 Newtowns models.
2. `client-patch.json` format 2: `Replace`/`Add` (from an overlay folder in the package) and `Omit`.
   Extend `ModernClientSetup.Install`, `make_client_patch.py`, `build_modern_test_package.py`
   (`check_package` must allow the overlay) and the launcher tests.
3. `zones/zones.mpk`: 1.130's `zones.dat` plus `[region276]`/`[zone276]` for Marfach Caverns.
4. A one-off script for the existing local test install (`artifacts/modern-client-test`), with a backup
   and rollback.
5. In-game check (below).

Estimate: 2-3 days, plus in-game testing.

**Risks:**
- The 1.130 client reading OpenDAoC's older-layout tables. The same files already load on the 1.127
  client, and the loader is shared, so the risk is low but only a real launch confirms it. If it fails,
  convert the classic tables to the 1.130 column layout, keeping positions and IDs.
- The modern package's rule is "no retail file ships". The overlay is OpenDAoC's modified world data, the
  same kind of content the classic packages already ship. Owner's call.
- Players on 1.130 see the classic world, not live's 2015 towns.

**In-game check:** Mag Mell, Druim Ligen (gate and guards), Cotswold, Mularn, Tir na Nog, Camelot,
Jordheim, one dungeon, a New Frontiers keep and relic gate, Marfach Caverns. Do it with GM off.

### Installed in the local test client (October 26, 2026)

`source/tools/modern_world_overlay.py` (tests: `test_modern_world_overlay.py`, 7 passing) applied the
overlay to `artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/client-modern/app`: 634 files replaced, 679 added,
196 Newtowns models removed (316 MB). The overlay takes the classic `zones/zones.mpk` whole. The 1.130
table also puts the battlegrounds Caledonia, Murdaigean and Thidranki in regions 166-168 (the server uses
250-252), and lacks Abermenai, Dodens Gruva, Marfach Caverns and Summoner's Hall. `game.dll`, the UI,
items, figures and effects were not touched. The test server kept running; it doesn't read client files.

**Checked after install** (doors and geometry exported from the patched client):
- All 333 doors identical to the classic client.
- 0 of 23,492 NPC spawns affected, in 44 zones including New Frontiers.

Not yet checked in game.

Backup and manifest: `artifacts/modern-client-test/backups/world-overlay-20261026-180051-287487`.
Rollback (close the client first; preview without `--apply`):

```
python source/tools/modern_world_overlay.py rollback artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/client-modern/app artifacts/modern-client-test/backups/world-overlay-20261026-180051-287487 --apply
```

## Fix B: move the server to live's world

**Work:**
1. **World database:** re-place the 469 NPC spawns. About half are a floor snap; spawns inside walls
   need placing by hand. Update about 200 door rows from the 1.130 export, and check bind points,
   teleports and world objects near the changed spots. Re-check keep guard and hookpoint placement on
   the six border keeps.
2. **Navmeshes:** rebuild every affected zone from 1.130 data. A 1.130 build differs from the installed
   mesh in nearly every tile; the installed meshes match the classic client exactly (0 tiles in Lough
   Derg and Connacht). Then rebuild ladder links (needs `Detour.dll` built), regenerate `roads.json`,
   `seams.json` and `pockets.json`, and re-prove bot routes (`UT_ZoneStepProbe`, soak runs).
3. **Bot code:** 13 hard-coded points sit in changed areas: RvR staging and raid muster at all six border
   keeps, a Cotswold route repair, the Lough Derg Shrouded Isles portal. Route hotspot repairs were tuned
   to classic geometry.
4. **The other clients now mismatch instead:**
   - The classic client needs live's world files (1,313 files plus 196 models). Either every player has a
     1.130 client to copy them from, or the project ships retail files.
   - The Godot client converts the classic client today. Reconvert from 1.130 data (its NIF reader
     handles 10.1) and re-verify props and doors.
5. Marfach Caverns still needs a 1.130 zone entry.
6. Future OpenDAoC upstream world updates assume the classic world and would conflict.

Estimate: several weeks, with the bot AI the main risk.

### Installed in the local test install (October 26, 2026)

Fix A was rolled back first. The test install now runs fix B:

| Part | What changed | Backup |
|---|---|---|
| Client | live 1.130 world files, plus the classic `zones/zones.mpk` (battleground regions, Marfach Caverns and the old RvR dungeons) and the `zone276` folder | `backups/world-overlay-20261026-192733-136443` |
| Navmeshes | 92 zones rebuilt from 1.130 data with `OpenDAoC-BuildNav` (ladders included); 81 differ from the classic meshes. Tuscaran Glacier re-run through `shadowfix.py` (1,339 polygons). `seams.json`, `pockets.json` and `roads.json` regenerated; the road proof (`UT_ZoneRoadBuild`) passed with 508,788 edges (classic: 510,548). The folder is now a real folder; it used to be a junction to Classic's meshes, which were not touched. | `backups/navmesh-20261026-192744-514841` |
| World (second plan, replacing the first after the in-game test) | `source/tools/live_world_migration.py`: 787 rows: 605 NPC spawns, 121 doors, 29 world objects, 16 zone arrival points, 7 teleports, 6 bind points, 3 safe areas. 54 left alone: 24 doors live doesn't have, about 20 NPCs in the zone-277 quest instance, 7 named NPCs in Dartmoor. | `backups/live-world-20261026-194915-735732` |

Staging, plan and logs: `artifacts/modern-client-test/fixb-staging`. Tools and tests: `live_world_migration.py`,
`live_world_navmesh.py`, `modern_world_overlay.py` (26 tests passing).

**Checked after install** (live geometry; spawns inside a wall or more than 64 units off the floor), in
12 key zones:
- Before: 534. After: 181. For comparison, the classic world on classic geometry scores 245 in the same zones.
- What remains is mostly swarms of flies, ambient rats and pixies.
- Zone borders: the same usable borders in all six regions as with the classic meshes.

**First in-game test:** Svasud Faste's NPCs stood in their usual layout, but outside the keep. Live pulled
three border keeps back inland and kept the old-frontier copies in the zone files where they can't be
reached:

| Keep | Classic | Live (inland) | Turn |
|---|---|---|---|
| Castle Sauvage | Forest Sauvage (585088, 477056) | Camelot Hills (583936, 486720) | 0° |
| Snowdonia Fortress | Snowdonia (528384, 358784) | Black Mtns. North (516608, 372800) | +45° |
| Svasud Faste | Uppland (766208, 669536) | Vale of Mularn (765312, 673472) | -9° |

The turn is measured from each copy's two gate doors. The fixture angles also include the models' own
facing: Druim Ligen and Druim Cain change fixture angle by 180° but face the same way in the world, which
is why their gate door IDs swapped. The second plan carries every NPC within 2,000 units, and the bind
points, teleports, banners, New Frontiers arrival points and safe area of each keep, with the keep. It
turns their headings too and sets them on the new floor (Castle Sauvage: 2600 → 2186).

**Rolling back the first plan** used `--skip-changed`. At startup the server had rewritten the three
dragons (Golestandt, Gjalpinulva, Cuuldurach) to the classic lair heights hard-coded in
`scripts/namedmobs/Dragons/DragonLairPlacement.cs` and the dragon scripts. It will keep doing that, about
150 units above live's lair floors, until that code changes.

**Town NPCs (open):** New Towns is a redesign, not a shift. In Cotswold, Mularn and Mag Mell most
merchants and trainers stand inside buildings that live moved 300-6,100 units (6-14 per building). They
are still near their classic spots. There is no live-era spawn data locally to restore from
(`offline_classic165_removed_mobs` has nothing near the new buildings).

**Bot code (follow-up, not deployed):** RvR staging and the raid muster hubs hard-code Castle Sauvage,
Snowdonia and Svasud Faste at their classic spots. Bots still work, but muster 4,000-18,000 units from the
inland keeps. The fix is to read the keep positions from the Area table, which the migration moves. It
needs a server build, which wasn't done while other uncommitted server work sits in the source.

**Bot code (snapping):** of the 12 hard-coded points, 9 are on live floor. Three (the Cotswold route repair, Druim
Ligen and Druim Cain RvR staging) are 144-190 units above the new floor. Their callers snap to the
navmesh within 256 or 600 units, so no code change was needed, and the shared source stays right for the
Classic and Stormforged editions.

**Not migrated:** saved player and gamebot positions. A bot standing in a changed spot is handled by the
stuck watchdog and the pockets file. Not yet tested in game.

**Rollback** (server and client closed; each previews without `--apply`), in this order:

```
python source/tools/live_world_migration.py rollback artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/data/opendaoc.sqlite3.db artifacts/modern-client-test/backups/live-world-20261026-194915-735732 --apply --skip-changed
python source/tools/live_world_navmesh.py rollback artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/server artifacts/modern-client-test/backups/navmesh-20261026-192744-514841 --apply
python source/tools/modern_world_overlay.py rollback artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/client-modern/app artifacts/modern-client-test/backups/world-overlay-20261026-192733-136443 --apply
```

To switch to fix A after that, re-apply the full overlay (`modern_world_overlay.py apply ... --apply`).

## Recommendation

**Fix A.** The server, database, navmeshes, bot AI and the other two clients are all classic. Fix A
changes only the 1.130 client, and the simulation shows it reproduces the classic world exactly. Fix B
is only worth it if live's look on 1.130 matters more than everything else staying as it is.

## Separate finding

This project's private art (custom pet models such as `ab_pet01` and `uh_hero01`, `q*` spell effects,
reskinned monsters, and their catalog rows in `gamedata.mpk`) exists only in the classic client. On
1.130 those pets and effects show stock or missing models. This needs its own patch step.
