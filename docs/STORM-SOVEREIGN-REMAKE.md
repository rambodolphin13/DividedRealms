# Storm Sovereign remake: Hammer, Axe and Shield

Status: owner approved 2026-11-04; built on feature/storm-remake. Orb colour chosen in game: **0x77** (blue ring, gold runes).
Not yet installed on the modern test world; not played.
Builds on `SOVEREIGN-IDENTITY-REDESIGN-PROPOSAL.md` (2026-10-25), narrowed to the owner's pick:
**Hammer, Axe and Shield**, with real offensive and defensive chains, still overpowered.

## What is wrong today

- Five weapon lines (Sword, Hammer, Axe, Spear, Shields), each with the same seven-style template:
  anytime, one follow-up, one reaction, one positional, a stun, a level-50 style that chains from nothing,
  and a stealth opener. No line has a real three-step chain, a block chain or a defensive branch.
- Every line's style effects come from one shared `index % 7` switch, so Hammer and Axe play the same.
- Pendragon (65) and Tuatha (67) reuse that same handler. The remake must not change them.
- Realm abilities: 36 inherited from Thane, including caster abilities the class can't use well
  (Mastery of Focus, Mastery of Concentration, Dual Threat, Raging Power, Serenity, Ethereal Bond).
- 23 spell buttons, several overlapping (three decrees, two self-heals, a ward split from Armor of the Crown).

## Weapons and setups

| Setup | Weapons | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Offensive | Two-handed hammer or two-handed axe | Biggest style damage, Tempest finishers, cleaves |
| Defensive | One-handed hammer or axe plus a large shield | Block chains, wards, retaliation, taunts, stuns |

Trained lines: **Hammer, Axe, Shields, Parry, Stealth**, all still matching character level automatically.
Sword and Spear stop being trained for this class. Characters keep any swords and spears they own (nothing is
deleted), but those lines' styles go away. New characters start with a one-handed hammer and a large shield.

## The core mechanic: Tempest

Up to **5 Tempest charges** (shown as a buff with a stack count). Gained from landing chain steps, blocks
and parries, at most one per swing. Lasts 30 seconds without fighting. Splash hits, procs and echoes never
build charges, so it can't loop.

Every landed melee hit also builds one charge (owner, 2026-11-04). Finishers and two spells **spend all charges** for a bigger effect: each charge adds +20% to the finisher's
lightning and +1 target to its arcs. Everything still works with zero charges; charges make it explode.

### How Tempest shows in game: Warlock chamber orbs

The classic Warlock chamber display (the orbs over the Warlock's head) is its own server packet
(`VisualEffect` sub-code 3, `PacketLib173.SendWarlockChamberEffect`) with **exactly five slots**, one byte each.
Tempest reuses it: each charge lights one orb over the Sovereign's head, every nearby player sees them, and
spending charges clears them. The stock packet colour codes are 0x03, 0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66 and 0x77
(one per old chamber type); we pick the one that looks blue and lightning-like.

Nothing in the client changes: no new art, no patched files. Two things are not known yet and get checked first:

1. Whether the 1.130 client still draws the orbs: **yes** (owner's screenshot, 2026-11-04).
2. Which colour code looks most like blue lightning: **0x77**, a blue lightning ring around gold runes. The GM command
   `/tempest cycle|show <code>|set <n>|color <code>|clear` stays for testing.

The orbs show the count, so no separate buff icon was added.

## Styles: 20 per line, 60 total

Unlocks every 2-3 levels, same schedule on each line so it's easy to learn. All three-step chains are real
`after style` chains; reactions use the engine's parry/block checks. Damage growth: openers 0.85, second
steps 1.1, finishers 1.45 (well above stock Thane). Stuns are 3 seconds (Shields 4) and use normal immunity.

## Realm abilities

  - *Shieldwall of Asgard:* block chance +3/6/9% and block chains add 10/20/30% to their wards.

## How it gets built

1. New C# handler `StormRemakeStyles` with one explicit entry per style (no shared index switch).
   New style IDs and spell IDs in a fresh private range; the old 1800-1834 styles and 62700-62734 effects stay for
   Pendragon and Tuatha, which are not touched.
2. A `TempestEffect` (stacking 0-5 charges, 30 s decay, no gain from splash/procs/echoes) that sends the chamber
   orb packet on every change and when a player comes into view. Built first, with the `/tempest show` test,
   so the owner can check the orbs and pick a colour before the styles go on top.
3. `seed_storm_remake.py`: idempotent, preview by default. It replaces class-64 styles, sets the
   trained lines, merges the spells, rebinds the RA list, and adds the three new RAs. It never writes player
   tables; trained RAs and inventories are kept.
4. Bots: update `BotClassKitPolicy`/`BotSpec` so Sovereign bots carry a hammer or axe plus a shield and use the new chains.
5. Tests: unit tests for every chain link and Tempest rule; then boot and a scripted fight on a **private copy**.
   Only then ask before installing on the modern test client.

## For the owner to check later in game

Each chain fires in order; block chains with a shield; parry chains with a two-hander; Tempest stack count
shows; finishers visibly hit harder with charges; Storm Crown fills Tempest; old sword/spear gear is still in bags.

drag new ones from the style and spell lists. Characters who had the old Runic Ward or Runic Armament switched on keep
those icons until they cancel them.
