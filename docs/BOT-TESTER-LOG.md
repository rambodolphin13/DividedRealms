# Bot tester log

Every bot plays as a tester:
- companion bots
- `/spawn` helpers
- account companions
- autonomous gamebots

While they play, the server records what each class's spells and styles actually do. It also records
what goes wrong. The log never changes a bot's decisions, and a logging failure never reaches the game.
The code is in `bots/BotTesterLog.cs`.

## Where to look

The files are in the server folder under `logs/bot-tester/`. In the modern test install that is
`artifacts/modern-client-test/runtime/server/logs/bot-tester/`.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `REPORT.txt` | Start here: findings sorted by severity, then one line per class |
| `summary-latest.json` | Every statistic, for each class, spell, pet spell and style |
| `events-YYYYMMDD.jsonl` | Individual events, one JSON object per line |

**When the report is written:**
- every 10 minutes (`bot_tester_report_minutes`)
- when the server stops
- when you type `/bottester`

**`/bottester` commands:**
- `/bottester` writes the report now and shows the top findings in chat.
- `/bottester verbose on` also logs every cast, spell hit and style until the server restarts.
- `/bottester reset` clears the statistics for a fresh test run. It writes the report first.

## What is recorded

- **Spells:**
  - Tries, casts, refusals and interrupts.
  - Resists, immunities and other negations.
  - Hits, damage and zero-damage hits.
  - A refused cast keeps the message the game sent, for example "You must wait 5 seconds to cast again"
    or "Your target is not in view".
- **Pet spells:** recorded under their owner's class.
- **Styles:**
  - Executions and their damage.
  - Failed executions, with the requirement that failed (position, opener style, previous attack result).
- **Exceptions:**
  - Any game service error involving a bot or its pet. That error also removes the bot from the world.
  - Logged with the spell it was casting and its last 8 actions.
- **Deaths:**
  - Who killed the bot.
  - Its power and endurance, its group size, its activity and pet.
  - Its last 8 actions.
- **Coverage:** the spells and styles each class knows, to find the ones its bots never use.

## Findings

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| critical | An exception (a code bug) |
| high | A spell that was never cast successfully, a style whose requirements always fail, or a damage spell that always deals 0 damage |
| medium | A spell that fails more than half the time, or a spell resisted or negated on 90% of casts |
| low | A spell interrupted more often than it is cast |
| info | A spell or style known but never tried; the bot AI may not use it |

A finding is a lead, not a verdict. A spell refused for "not in view" points at bot positioning. A
damage spell that always deals 0 points at the spell itself.

## Volume

- **Events:** problem events only, with each repeat (same bot, skill and reason) logged at most once
  every 5 minutes. The counts in the report still include every occurrence.
- **Daily cap:** events stop at 256 MB a day. Reports continue.
- **Turning it off:** set `bot_tester / bot_tester_log` to False.
