# Work so far (October 2026, 0.38 development)

A guide to what this round of work adds on top of the 0.37 release. Almost all of it lives in the **modern client
test installation** (`artifacts/modern-client-test`, the original retail 1.130 client), not in the Classic or
Stormforged releases. Each area links its own document for the details.

**Status:** server built and started by the owner, with the full automated test suite passing (3,503 C# tests, plus
the class tools' Python tests). In-game testing of the newest class work is still to do; see the end of this page.

## Modern client test installation

- **The 1.130 client:** the original retail client now connects ([MODERN-CLIENT-TEST.md](MODERN-CLIENT-TEST.md)). It
  is bundled and patched for the custom classes ([MODERN-CUSTOM-CLIENT.md](MODERN-CUSTOM-CLIENT.md)).
- **Races:** all 21 realm races are available, Minotaurs and Half-Ogre included ([MODERN-RACES.md](MODERN-RACES.md)).
- **Native class slots:** client class slots for the expansion and royal classes (`source/tools/classslots`).
- **Trainers:**
  - Expansion class trainers are imported from Eve of Darkness ([EXPANSION-TRAINERS.md](EXPANSION-TRAINERS.md)).
  - Every class trainer wears its class's armor ([TRAINER-ARMOR.md](TRAINER-ARMOR.md)).

## Classes

### Every class toward live 1.130a

The goal is each class's spells, values and abilities as on live 1.130a. By name, 99% of live's class spells are in
the modern test world. The classic shade Necromancer is kept on purpose.

**How it's built.** Python migrations in `source/tools`, installed together by
`install_hybrid_lines.py`. It previews by default; `--apply` writes. It backs up, verifies the world, refuses to run
while a server is up, and supports `--rollback`. The steps run in this order:

| Step | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `remove_sluaghbinder.py` | drops the retired class's world rows |
| `hybrid_lines.py` | the hybrid classes' live lines and class abilities |
| `class_lines.py` | the other classes' live spells |
| `archery.py` | live archery |
| `proc_lines.py` | class proc buffs |
| `linked_lines.py` | totems, commands and other parent/child spells |
| `envenom_lines.py` | the assassins' live poisons |
| `round3_lines.py` | the remaining classes, the level 50 nukes, the seventh pass and the live pets |
| `spell_drift.py` | live values for stock spells |
| `audit_corrections.py` | corrections from a full audit |
| `dot_timing.py` | live duration and tick for damage-over-time spells |
| `live_spell_art.py` | the client's own spell art |

**Units** (live value → this server's table):
- Direct damage: × 0.0992.
- Lifedrains, damage shields and damage adds: ÷ 10.
- Cast time: live timer ÷ 1000 + 2 s (a timer of 1 is instant).
- A snare's Value: 100 − the speed left.
- Duration and recast: seconds. Frequency: tenths of a second.

**New mechanics** (server code, `spells/LiveClassEffectHandlers.cs`, `LiveGapHandlers.cs`, `LiveRound7Handlers.cs`):
- Wizard Ice Grip, Flame Cocoon and Warrior Battle Control (grapples).
- Assassin Overshadow (hide an ally).
- Thane Chain Lightning.
- Mentalist Speedwarp (a ward that negates speed boosts).
- Druid Heart of Nature.
- Enchanter Enchantments of Stone, Fire, Truth and Zeal.
- Siegebreaker, Reaver Malefic Horror and Shaman Blight Surge.
- Earlier passes: totems, damage reduction, Helping Hand, Track, damage-type auras and others.

**The live pets:**
- **Animist:** bombers, spore and heal turrets, Shroom of Life and the three level 40 main pets.
- **Spiritmaster:** the five class spirits and Gates of Valhalla.
- **Druid:** Grove Guardian, Grove Protector and Nature Sage.
- **Enchanter:** Underhill Stalker.

Each pet uses a copy of the closest stock template under the live name. Their per-pet spell kits are not yet live's.

**Not yet built:**
- Cabalist Simulacrum Soul, Fortitude and Resilience (no source for what they do).
- The Valkyrie's Valkyrie's Supremacy and Odin's Hope.
- The Mauler Farseer realm gift damage for ranks 1-4, and Siegebreaker's bonus for controlled siege weapons (no
  figures).

**Simplified:**
- Chain Lightning's jump radius and falloff, and Zeal's shared group heal: live gives no figures.
- Heart of Nature's root grants no immunity afterwards.
- Enchantment of Ice doesn't change the melee damage type.

**Local-only data:** six data files the class migrations read (`archery_data.py`, `class_lines_data.py`,
`class_lines_data_v2.py`, `dot_timing_data.py`, `spell_drift_data.py`, `audit_corrections_data.py`) are derived from
daoc.gg's data. They are kept out of the repository for now, and so is the class research behind them. A clone can't
rerun the class migrations; the playable build carries their results in its world database.

### New and expansion classes (modern test, first playable versions)

- **Expansion classes:**
  - Death Knight, the live Necromancer, beside the classic one ([DEATH-KNIGHT-MODERN-TEST.md](DEATH-KNIGHT-MODERN-TEST.md)).
  - Bainshee, Vampiir and Heretic ([EXPANSION-CLASSES-MODERN-TEST.md](EXPANSION-CLASSES-MODERN-TEST.md)).
  - Valkyrie ([VALKYRIE-MODERN-TEST.md](VALKYRIE-MODERN-TEST.md), [VALKYRIE-PROGRESSION.md](VALKYRIE-PROGRESSION.md)).
  - Warlock ([WARLOCK-MODERN-TEST.md](WARLOCK-MODERN-TEST.md)).
  - Mauler in all three realms ([MAULER-MODERN-TEST.md](MAULER-MODERN-TEST.md)).
- **Royal classes:** Storm Sovereign (Midgard, replacing Stormforged in the modern test), Pendragon Sovereign (Albion)
  and Tuatha Sovereign (Hibernia) ([STORM-SOVEREIGN.md](STORM-SOVEREIGN.md), [PENDRAGON-SOVEREIGN.md](PENDRAGON-SOVEREIGN.md),
  [TUATHA-SOVEREIGN.md](TUATHA-SOVEREIGN.md)). The older Stormforged design stays documented in
  [STORMFORGED.md](STORMFORGED.md).
- **The Sluaghbinder is retired:** its server code is removed and `remove_sluaghbinder.py` drops its world rows.

## Progression

- **Master Levels:** all eight paths, earned from level 50 experience ([MASTER-LEVELS.md](MASTER-LEVELS.md)).
- **Champion Levels:** 1-15, earned from realm points at level 50 ([CHAMPION-LEVELS.md](CHAMPION-LEVELS.md)).
- **Live realm abilities:** the RR5 abilities, and Tireless free at level one ([LIVE-RA-MODERNIZATION.md](LIVE-RA-MODERNIZATION.md)).

## Combat and rules

- **Chants:** they stack as on live ([MULTIPLE-CHANTS.md](MULTIPLE-CHANTS.md)).
- **Spell pushback:** capped damage pushback for spell casting ([SPELL-CAST-PUSHBACK.md](SPELL-CAST-PUSHBACK.md)).
- **Recovery:** out-of-combat recovery floors for players ([RECOVERY-AND-BUFF-UPKEEP.md](RECOVERY-AND-BUFF-UPKEEP.md)).

## Bots and companions

- **Buffs:** the order bots and companions hand out buffs in ([BUFF_RULES.md](BUFF_RULES.md)).
- **Account companions:** specialization lines trained by hand and a free respec from the training page.
- **Gamebots:** AI fixes from the soak runs, such as healer bots finishing a spell they're already casting, and
  pet-combat and loot-flow fixes.

## Launcher

The launcher has a modern client profile: client and helper paths come from the profile and are hash-checked before
launch.

## What still needs in-game testing

Automated tests and the server start pass. In-game checks are still to do for:
- **The newest class work:** the grapples, Overshadow, Speedwarp, the enchantments, Chain Lightning, Blight Surge, the
  charms and the live pets.
- **Earlier value changes:** Cavern Unity 24 → 12, the Bonedancer skeleton snares 5/10/15%, Shroud of Doubt 50 → 20,
  Arthritic Curse 3 → 6, and the live DoT timing.
