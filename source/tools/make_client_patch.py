"""Make the modern client patch that players apply to their own 1.130 client (no retail file ships, see Marfach below).

    python make_client_patch.py <pristine 1.130 client folder> <classic client folder> <client-patch.json>

Runs the hash-guarded class-slot patch (classslots/patch_class_slots.py: game.dll's native class slots 63-67 and
the creation screen's extra class buttons in pregame/character_creation.xml) on the pristine files, then records
only the edits (our hooks, section and added buttons, not Broadsword's bytes) with each file's input and output
SHA256. The launcher's client setup (OfflineDaoc.Launcher/ModernClientSetup.cs) copies the player's client and applies
these edits in order; it refuses any input that isn't the pristine 1.130 file. These two files and the splash below are
the only client files the modern test changes (a full hash comparison of the test client with a pristine 1.130 client,
2026-10-25, before the splash and the zone table below).

The loading screen, pregame/splash.mpk, is replaced whole by the Divided Realms splash (our own art,
OfflineDaoc.Launcher/Assets/divided-realms-client-splash.mpk): one edit that removes the stock archive and inserts ours,
guarded by the stock file's SHA256 like the others.

The stock zone table, zones/zones.mpk, has none of the regions the server uses for the four battlegrounds and the old RvR
dungeons: entering one dropped the player to character select or left them out of bounds. Its zones.dat is compressed, so
a byte edit of the archive would ship Mythic's whole table. Instead an entry with Member edits the file inside a
single-file archive and the launcher rebuilds the archive with stored zlib blocks, which Python and .NET write byte for
byte alike. Only our added sections and changed values ship.

Live walled off the frontier gates of Castle Sauvage, Snowdonia Fortress and Druim Cain: each zone's bound.csv, which the
client enforces, closes the gate and the way out of the zone, so the gate opens and the player still can't walk through
(issue #2, a bound wall exactly where the 2026-10-28 walk links cross). Those zones' dat and csv archives get Member
edits that swap the closing walls for the classic client's, whose ends meet the neighbouring zones' unchanged walls.
Live also put zone jumps at all six border keeps' frontier gates (a Frontier jump to New Frontiers and untargeted Border /
artfix lines); GATE_JUMPS takes them out of those zones' zonejump.csv, so the gates lead into the old frontiers again.

An entry with From makes a new file from another stock file: Abermenai's terrain is Thidranki's with the archive renamed
(add_abermenai_terrain.py).

The private fishing rod (tools/pet-art/install_fishing_rod.py, the server's fishing_pole_model 4927 and 4928) comes two ways
with nothing retail in it: items/offline_fishrod01.nif is made From the player's own quarterstaff NIF with only our vertex
positions and bounding sphere, and one gamedata.mpk entry with Members adds our three rows to objects.csv and items.csv,
one member after the other. Building the patch needs numpy (the rod's mesh code).

The Sovereign Regalia art (tools/sovereign-art: Regalia of Tara and of Camelot, objects 4950-4963) is our painted skins on
stock meshes: each kit's two skin archives (pskin062/mskin071, pskin063/mskin072) are made From a stock skin archive and
ship whole, since every texture in them is ours, and its pskins.csv, mskins.csv and objects.csv rows join the rod's in the
one gamedata.mpk entry. The archives use a fixed member time, so the same textures give the same bytes. Building them
needs Pillow. The Storm Regalia (objects 4929-4942) is not in the patch: its art is a separate experimental kit.

Marfach Caverns (region 276) is the one exception to shipping nothing retail, by the owner's decision (2026-10-30): 1.130
has no copy of its map, so dat276.mpk and its sounds.dat (about 20 KB, read from the classic client when the patch is
built, never kept in Git) travel inside the patch as whole-file edits. The dungeon models it places are stock.
